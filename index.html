						My name is Chan Woo Kim and I am from South Korea. I'm currently a student at Shanghai American School Puxi Campus. I'm seventeen and in junior year, class of 2019. I am a full-stack developer and also very interested in machine intelligence. I am also a music producer & recording engineer on the side and run a music label called <a href="http://amptonerecords.com">Amptone Records</a>.
						<br/><br/>
						You can find my resume <a href="https://github.com/codeandproduce/resume">here</a>.
						<br/><br/>
						I actually also have a video resume I made for applying to MIT LaunchX. The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y8xEhEWlV0">here</a>.
						<br/><br/>
						I run a publication on Medium called <a href="https://medium.com/machine-learning-intuition">Machine Learning Intuition</a>, the purpose of which is to allow interested people to have a very intuitive introduction to many concepts in machine learning as well as philosophical aspects of A.I. Please make sure you check it out! I spend a lot of time on it.
						<br/><br/>
						At school, I'm the Vice President of Science National Honor Society, Founder and President of Developers' Hub, where I teach over 15 students elements of software engineering through web development and git, a link crew leader, a member of the National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, and National English Honor Society, a sprinter in <a href="https://recruit-match.ncsasports.org/clientrms/athletes/5154212">Varsity Track & Field</a>, and a Winger for the Varsity Rugby team.

						My research interests include: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GANs, making sense of the learning inside the black-box, and Hierarchal Temporal Memory<br/><br/>
						I've conducted research as an entry to the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. The purpose of the project was to use NLP methods (Text Vectorization, N-Grams, TF-IDF, Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization) on Windows API System Calls to detect malware. Our model achieved a highest of 98% accuracy and we were named to be Intel ISEF finalists. The project also won the Yale Science and Engineering Award. <br/><br/>
						The paper can be found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05412"> <i>
(arXiv) NtMalDetect: A Machine Learning Approach to Malware Detection Using Native API System Calls</i></a>
						<br/><br/>
						I self-studied Linear Algebra and Multivariable calculus on top of finishing AP Calculus BC at school and finished Andrew Ng's courses to make all this happen. I am now comfortable with much of the theoretical foundations as well as using TensorFlow and other Python modules. I am currently looking for research opportunities and willing to devote much of my time to research. Please contact me if there are such opportunities.

						Making apps was how I got into computer science in the beginning back in middle school. Today, I work with: <br/><br/>
						<span class="coding-languages">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Git, data science in Python (sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas, etc), bash, Java, Docker, nginx</span>
						<br/><br/>
						I've created apps and websites for personal projects as well as for companies. I've also created open source projects. My team has actually been written about in a <a href="https://blog.manifold.co/hackathon-spotlight-my-chat-with-webhacks-winner-milky-505dea8ddc9f"> company website</a> for winning first place for <a href="https://webhacks.tech/">WebHacks2017</a>!
						
						<br/><br/>
						I've dedicated a separate page for my projects. Find out more about my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.
