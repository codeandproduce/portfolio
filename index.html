						My name is Chan Woo Kim and I am from South Korea. I'm currently a student at Shanghai American School Puxi Campus. I'm seventeen and in junior year, class of 2019. Some of my various interests/work include full-stack development, research in machine intelligence, and music! With music, I run as part of an executive team a music label called <a href="http://amptonerecords.com">Amptone Records</a> as the Chief Technology Officer. I am also a track & field athlete, a rugby athlete, a math nerd, a philosophy nerd, and an avid Redditor! 
						<br/><br/>
						On the side, I publication on Medium called <a href="https://medium.com/machine-learning-intuition">Machine Learning Intuition</a>, the purpose of which is to allow interested people to have a very intuitive introduction to many concepts in machine learning as well as philosophical aspects of A.I. Please make sure you check it out! I spend a lot of time on it.
						<br/><br/>
						At school, I'm the Vice President of Science National Honor Society, Founder and President of Developers' Hub, where I teach over 15 students elements of software engineering through web development and Git, Public Relations Officer of the National Honor Society, a link crew leader, a member of Mu Alpha Theta and National English Honor Society, a sprinter in <a href="https://recruit-match.ncsasports.org/clientrms/athletes/5154212">Varsity Track & Field</a>, and a Winger for the Varsity Rugby team.

						My research interests include: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GANs, making sense of the learning inside the black-box, and Hierarchal Temporal Memory<br/><br/>
						I've conducted research as an entry to the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. The purpose of the project was to use NLP methods (Text Vectorization, N-Grams, TF-IDF, Linear Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization, and Coordinate Descent Optimization on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM) on Windows API System Calls to detect malware. Our model achieved a highest of 96% accuracy and we were named to be Intel ISEF finalists. The project also won the Yale Science and Engineering Award, 4th place Grand Award at Intel ISEF, and special awards from numerous organizations.<br/><br/>
						The paper can be found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05412"> <i>
(arXiv) NtMalDetect: A Machine Learning Approach to Malware Detection Using Native API System Calls</i></a>
						<br/><br/>
						I self-studied Linear Algebra and Multivariable calculus on top of finishing AP Calculus BC at school and finished Andrew Ng's courses to make all this happen. I am now comfortable with much of the theoretical foundations as well as using TensorFlow and other Python modules. I am currently looking for research opportunities and willing to devote much of my time to research. Please contact me if there are such opportunities.

						Making apps was how I got into computer science in the beginning back in middle school. Today, I work with: <br/><br/>
						<span class="coding-languages">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Git, data science in Python (sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas, etc), bash, Java, Docker, nginx</span>
						<br/><br/>
						I've created apps and websites for personal projects as well as for companies. I've also created open source projects. My team has actually been written about in a <a href="https://blog.manifold.co/hackathon-spotlight-my-chat-with-webhacks-winner-milky-505dea8ddc9f"> company website</a> for winning first place for <a href="https://webhacks.tech/">WebHacks2017</a>!

						I've dedicated a separate page for my projects. Find out more about my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.
